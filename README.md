# Tour and Travel Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn for a travel company using a dataset with indicators such as age, frequent flyer status, annual income class, service usage frequency, social media account synchronization, and hotel bookings. The goal is to build predictive models that help optimize resource allocation and improve customer retention strategies.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals insights into customer behavior.
- **Modeling**: A Random Forest classifier is implemented for churn prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are provided for assessing model performance.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **87.43%**, demonstrating strong precision and recall for identifying non-churned customers. Recommendations for enhancing model performance and feature engineering are included.
